            <li>sugar</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>3 1/4 all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S pizza crust yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups of very warm water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup oil</li>
            <li>6 ounces of pepperoni</li>
            <li>1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a 
                medium bowl; set aside for flavours to develop while making 
                crust.
            </li>
            
            <li>Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, 1 tablespoon 
                sugar and 1 1/2 teapsoons salt. Add water and oil, and mix
                until well blendeed (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough
                remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is 
                formed
            </li>

            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough 
                is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed.
            </li>

            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into
                a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.
            </li>

            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese
                is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and
                bottom oven racks halfway through baking.
            </li>
        </ol>
